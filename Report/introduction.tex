The first part of the lab was to implement a compiler for Toy Object-Oriented Language (Tool),
which is a small object-oriented programming language.
\newline
This has led us to conceive a Lexer, a \(LL(1)\) grammar, a Parser, a Type Checking system and
to generate binary code for the Java Virtual Machine.
\newline
The aim of this project is to replace code generation for the Java Virtual Machine
with a pretty printer, which outputs C code.
\newline
The difficulty is to make object-oriented code into C code which does not have built in data types to support classes, 
as it is an imperative programming language .
